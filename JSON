##Using titanic dataset
df = load_dataset("titanic")
df.head()

##list passengers, in which each element is a dictionary with the keys being sex, pclass, and embark_town and the values being their corresponding values in df.
passengers = []

for idx, val in df.iterrows():
    sex = val.sex
    pclass = val.pclass
    town = val.embark_town
    
    passenger = {"sex": sex, "pclass": pclass, "town": town}
    passengers.append(passenger)
    
passengers[:5]

##Serialize passengers as a JSON formatted stream to a file named ex_passengers.json
with open("ex_passengers.json", "w") as fw:
    json.dump(passengers, fw)
    
##Deserialize the ex_passengers.json file under the directory data to a Python list named passengers_new.
with open("ex_passengers.json", "r") as fr:
    passengers_new = json.load(fr)
    
passengers_new[:5]
